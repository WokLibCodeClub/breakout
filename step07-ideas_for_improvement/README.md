# Step 7 - Ideas for a better game

Of course, no game is ever finished. There are always things we can do to improve them. Here are some suggestions for making Breakout even better:

#### 1. Randomise the ball starting position or velocities

You might notice that since the ball always starts from the same position it always follows the same route during the game. One way to change this is to make the ball start from a random position. 

To do this we have to import the Python function to generate random integers from the **random** library. At the top of your code (before the variable declarations) add:

`from random import randint`



2. Let the bat give the ball some spin

#### 2. Play again?
