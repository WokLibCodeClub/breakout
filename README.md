# breakout

This is a version of the old arcade video game *Breakout*. You can see an example of what the game looked like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaCY6QQZVEc).

The code you write for this project will run using the Python extension library called **Pygame Zero**.

If you are unfamiliar with the way Pygame Zero works it would be a good idea to try the project *LetterA* first, as this give a full explanation. [Go to LetterA](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/LetterA)

To run your code you will need a terminal window - you can either use the Windows command window, or if you are editing using Visual Studio Code you can open a terminal window using View>Terminal (View> Integrated Terminal on older versions of VS Code). You must navigate the terminal window to the folder where your Python code has been saved. If the Python code is in a file called breakout.py you would run the code using Pygame Zero by typing:
```
pgzrun breakout.py
```

Details about downloading and installing Pygame Zero are found here

Now, get started coding your own version of *breakout*.
