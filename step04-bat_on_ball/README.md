# Step 4 - Add some sounds

If you've followed the instructions in Step 2 your code should look like the code in breakout3.py on this page. You will see in function update() that the if statements to check if the ball goes off the left or right edges have been combined into a single if statement by using the connecting word **or**.

1. Make a folder called **sounds**

   The old arcade games used to make really annoying sounds as you played them, so our version of Breakout will include some of these sounds, to be realistic.
   When you use sounds in a Pygame Zero project you need to create a folder called **sounds** where you can store all the sound files.
